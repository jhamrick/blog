How do people learn about underlying physical parameters, such as mass
and friction, from the interactions of objects in complex, dynamical
scenes? Discovering the values of such properties is a difficult task:
the parameters cannot be observed directly, and their influence on the
sequence of dynamics is often complicated and difficult to resolve
unambiguously. Yet, people can do this. We showed participants towers
of blocks stacked in complex configurations, and asked them to predict
whether each tower would fall. After giving them the correct answer,
we asked a further question: which blocks were heavier? With the
correct information about stability, participants rapidly learned the
blocks' relative masses. We propose that this learning can be viewed
as probabilistic inference in a generative model that approximates
Newtonian rigid-body dynamics. To express this hypothesis, we built a
model that uses physical simulation and Monte Carlo sampling to
predict what will happen and then to update its beliefs based on the
divergence of its predictions from reality. Participants' judgments
were qualitatively consistent with those of this physics-aware model
observer, but also deviated in key ways that may be explained by
information and resource limitations. This is an important step in
understanding how people perceive and reason about the physical nature
of their environment, and provides a working framework for modeling
and testing people's inferences about unobserved properties in
complex, real-world scenes.
